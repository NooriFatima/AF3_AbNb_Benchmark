We provide relevant code for benchmarking and visualizing results here. 

We have made our code files available to encourage standardized benchmarking for new algorithms and benchmarks to expand on. 

## Code Structure:

all files named `run_*.sh` are SLURM scripts that can be used to run files in the `scripts` folder
